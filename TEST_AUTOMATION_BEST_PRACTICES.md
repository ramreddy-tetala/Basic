# Test Automation Best Practices

## 🏗️ 1. Project Structure
- Use the **Page Object Model (POM)** for organizing your code.
- Group related tests in meaningful packages.

## 🧪 2. Test Writing
- Each test method should validate a single scenario.
- Use meaningful method names like `testLoginWithValidCredentials()`.
- Write both positive and negative test cases.

## 🛠️ 3. Maintainability
- Avoid hard-coding locators; use constants or properties files.
- Reuse code via helper/util classes when possible.

## ⏱️ 4. Waits and Timing
- Prefer **Explicit Waits** (e.g., `WebDriverWait`) over hard sleeps.
- Avoid using `Thread.sleep()` unless absolutely necessary.

## ♻️ 5. Test Data Management
- Isolate data so tests don’t interfere with each other.
- Use setup and teardown methods (`@Before`, `@After`) in test frameworks like JUnit/TestNG for initializing/cleaning.

## 🔄 6. Independence
- Tests should be able to run individually or in any order.
- Avoid dependencies between test cases.

## 🧹 7. Cleanup
- Ensure proper cleanup after test execution (e.g., closing browsers, deleting test data).

## 👀 8. Logging, Reporting, Diagnostics
- Use logging frameworks to record progress and errors.
- Implement screenshots on test failure.

## 🖥️ 9. Continuous Integration (CI)
- Integrate tests with a CI system (e.g., Jenkins, GitHub Actions).
- Run tests in headless mode and on multiple browsers when possible.

## 📊 10. Reporting
- Generate test reports (HTML, XML) for visibility of outcomes.
- Attach logs and screenshots for failed tests.
