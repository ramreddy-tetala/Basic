# Workflow Differences: QA vs Development

Understanding the distinctions between Quality Assurance (QA) and Development (Dev) workflows is crucial for effective collaboration and delivery of high-quality software. Below is an overview comparing their tools, processes, and daily tasks.

## 1. Key Focus Areas

- **Development:**  
  Building new features, fixing bugs, and implementing technical solutions according to product requirements.

- **QA:**  
  Ensuring software meets quality standards, identifying defects, validating functionality, and verifying user acceptance.

## 2. Tools

| Area            | Development Tools                                 | QA Tools                                            |
|-----------------|---------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| **Version Control** | Git, GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket                 | Git (for test scripts), GitHub                      |
| **IDEs**           | VSCode, IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, WebStorm        | VSCode, Eclipse (for test automation)               |
| **Build/CI/CD**    | Jenkins, GitHub Actions, CircleCI               | Jenkins, CircleCI (for automated testing pipelines) |
| **Issue Tracking** | Jira, Trello, Asana                             | Jira, TestRail (for test case management)           |
| **Testing**        | Jest, Mocha, RSpec, Postman (API)               | Selenium, Cypress, JMeter, Postman, TestRail        |
| **Code Quality**   | SonarQube, ESLint, Prettier                     | Allure, Zephyr, QTest                               |

## 3. Processes

### Development

1. **Requirement Analysis**
    - Refine user stories, clarify acceptance criteria.
2. **Design & Architecture**
    - Propose solutions, perform code reviews.
3. **Implementation**
    - Write code, unit tests, and documentation.
4. **Code Review & Merge**
    - Peer code reviews, resolve merge conflicts.
5. **Continuous Integration**
    - Push code to main branch, trigger builds.

### QA

1. **Test Planning**
    - Define scope, objectives, and types of testing.
2. **Test Case Development**
    - Create manual/automated test cases based on requirements.
3. **Test Execution**
    - Run test cases, automate regression tests.
4. **Defect Reporting**
    - Log bugs, retest once fixed.
5. **Quality Reporting**
    - Document test results, provide metrics.

---

## 4. Typical Daily Tasks

### Developer

- Attend standups and sprint ceremonies
- Pick tasks from the board
- Write and test new code/features
- Review and merge code (PRs)
- Fix bugs assigned
- Sync with QA if clarifications are needed

### QA

- Attend standups and sprint ceremonies
- Sync with devs for build availability
- Write/execute/maintain test cases
- Run smoke, regression, exploratory testing
- Log defects and validate fixes
- Report testing progress and issues

---

## 5. Interactions and Handoffs

- **Dev → QA:**  
  After code is merged and builds are available, dev notifies QA for validation.

- **QA → Dev:**  
  QA reports defects with detailed reproduction steps; dev reviews and fixes.

- **Collaboration:**  
  Both roles participate in sprint planning, backlog refinement, and retrospectives.

|------------------|------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| **Primary Output**   | Source code, unit tests, documentation          | Test cases, bug reports, test metrics               |

| **Cycle Entry**      | Start of sprint/feature planning                | After code build is ready, during/after dev         |
| **Cycle Exit**       | Feature/bug delivered, code merged              | Feature signed off, bugs closed or accepted         |
| **Metrics**          | Code quality, build status, velocity            | Test coverage, pass/fail rate, defect counts        |
